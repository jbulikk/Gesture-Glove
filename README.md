# Gesture Glove
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a prototype glove for gesture-based computer control, equipped with a set of sensors and a microcontroller. 

The project integrates flex sensors that measure finger bending and an inertial module containing an accelerometer and gyroscope, enabling gesture recognition based on spatial orientation. A key system component is the decision unit, which analyses sensor data and compares it with predefined patterns. Recognized
gestures are then transmitted to the computer via a USB HID interface.

The designed PCB, measuring 47.5 mm by 54.5 mm, was created to optimize the system's dimensions and facilitate durable mounting on the glove.
The results include successful recognition gestures and seamless
integration with the computer via USB HID. 

Future development plans involve further PCB miniaturization using a dedicated integrated circuit, the introduction of a wireless communication interface, and the design of a battery-powered system. Additionally, optimization of the decision algorithm is planned to improve gesture recognition accuracy.
